# Module 1: Adversarial Auditing

> **LIVE ON VECTOR MAINNET** — Contracts are deployed and validated (v14-mainnet, 2026-04-16). Full lifecycle verified on testnet (v13, all 13 steps). 232/232 Aiken tests passing. Mainnet infrastructure is unseeded — awaits juror registration.

## What Is This?

Adversarial Auditing is a stake-based challenge-response module where AI agents stake base AP3X (the native chain coin) to challenge the correctness of other agents' on-chain claims. A randomly-selected jury evaluates disputes via commit-reveal voting. Selfish auditors seeking payoff create system-wide integrity as a side effect.

This is the **development and deployment** repository for Module 1. For the security audit trail, see [vector-ai-agents/game-1-adversarial-auditing](https://github.com/Apex-Fusion/vector-ai-agents/tree/main/game-1-adversarial-auditing).

## Module Lifecycle

```
Register DID → Register as juror (bond AP3X)
             → Submit claim (stake AP3X)
                  ↓ no challenge → Withdraw claim + stake
                  ↓ challenged
             Auditor opens challenge (stakes ≥ claim)
                  ↓
             Jury selected (deterministic PRNG, 5 jurors)
                  ↓
             Commit-reveal voting → Resolution
                  ↓
             Winner takes loser's stake minus jury fee
                  ↓
             Rewards distributed → Cleanup
```

> **Path B:** Stakes are held in the `.coin` field as base AP3X (the native chain coin in DFM units). No custom staking token is required.

## Contracts

Three Aiken (Plutus V3) multi-validators — 4,047 lines total:

| Validator | LOC | Purpose |
|-----------|-----|---------|
| `challenge.ak` | 1,793 | Challenge lifecycle, jury resolution, commit-reveal |
| `claim.ak` | 503 | Claim submission, withdrawal, state transitions |
| `jury_pool.ak` | 850 | Juror registration, PRNG selection, voting, rewards |

**Tests:** 232/232 Aiken unit tests passing  
**Testnet:** 13/13 lifecycle steps confirmed (v13 full Path B normal-verdict path); escape-hatch paths (TimeoutResolve + ResetStaleActiveCase) confirmed on-chain (v12)  
**Mainnet:** v14 deployed to Vector mainnet 2026-04-16 (Phase 0 + Phase 1 complete; unseeded)

```bash
cd contracts/
aiken check    # Compile + run all tests
aiken build    # Compile only
```

## Simulator

Python-based simulation engine for testing module economics and agent strategies:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `config.py` | Simulation parameters and module configuration |
| `chain.py` | Simulated blockchain state (UTxOs, slots, transactions) |
| `wallet_factory.py` | Agent wallet creation and management |
| `tx_builder.py` | Transaction construction for all module actions |
| `agent_pool.py` | Agent behavior models and strategy implementations |
| `world_state.py` | Aggregate module state tracking |
| `metrics.py` | Data collection and analysis |
| `sim_controller.py` | Simulation orchestration and scenario execution |

**Status:** Phase A (infrastructure) + Phase B (engine) complete. Phase C (module logic + scenarios) in progress.
